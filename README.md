### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

![Nicolas' github stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=nicoonguitar&count_private=true&show_icons=true)

Iâ€™m a software engineer, focusing on iOS and IoT product development.

I started my iOS development career at [Elun](http://elun.cl), a Chilean mobile app factory, working on various contextual-location-aware projects using GPS and iBeacon technologies. Three years later, I led the iOS teams at [TheBesty](https://keyopass.com), an Chilean-American app for travelers with tour booking and real-time chat with hotel concierges, to later join [Velco](https://velco.bike), building French IoT products for smart mobility and vehicle tracking systems.

My last full-time experience was at [Netatmo](https://www.netatmo.com), contributing to the development and maintenance of several smart home products, where the highlights were working with HomeKit and low-level networking APIs (Bonjour, WAC, CoreBluetooth) as well as the usage of technologies as WebRTC for video call features.

Today, I work as a freelancer for Apple's platforms.

As a [conference speaker](https://github.com/nigarcia88/talks), I presented a talk about UI testing and push notifications at CocoaHeads Nantes and iOS Love Chile meetups. Also, I gave a talk about overseas remote work and multicultural teams in [9punto5](https://2018.9punto5.cl) conference.
